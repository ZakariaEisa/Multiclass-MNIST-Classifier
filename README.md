# Multiclass MNIST Classification from Scratch

This project implements a **fully connected neural network from scratch** using **NumPy** to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The network is trained using **tanh activation functions** in the hidden layers and **softmax** for the output layer.

## Features

- Custom 3-layer fully connected neural network
- Forward and backward propagation implemented manually
- Cross-entropy loss
- Mini-batch gradient descent
- One-hot encoding for labels
- Experiments with different architectures and activation functions

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ZakariaEisa/mnist-classification.git
cd mnist-classification
